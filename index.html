        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>All Data Structures projects:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/CISC3130-Lab-1.git">Lab 1</a>
                <p>The first lab assignment for CISC3130: Data Structures, a simple "hello world" Java program.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/Spotify-Top-200-Artist-Report-Producer.git">Lab 2</a>
                <p>This project takes a Spotify Top 200 Artists csv file as input and returns a report containing all artists that appear in alphabetical order and the amount of time each artist appears.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/Spotify_Top_200_Artists_Report_Producer.git">Lab 3</a>
                <p>This project reads a csv file from Spotify's website for their top 200 artists and creates a report containing all the artists that appear on the list. This project is mainly to practice creating custom Node and LinkedLists classes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/CISC3130_Lab_4.git">Lab 4</a>
                <p>This project creates a playlist of songs that appeared in the top 200 list on Spotify for an entire fiscal quarter. The songs are extracted from 13 csv files from spotifycharts.com. This project implements custom stack and queue and LinkedList
                    classes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/CISC3130-Lab-5">Lab 5</a>
                <p>This program produces a report of all artists that appear on Spotify's top 200 lists for a certain month in ascending alphabetical order. This is done using a custom binary search tree class. </p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/Course-Grade-Calculator.git">Lab 6</a>
                <p>This program is calculator that calculates my current score for my Data Structures course based on the assignments and exams completed and the grades achieved on them as of the time of whenever the program is run. The program informs me
                    of what I need to do and how much I need to score on the final exam to recieve a final grade of "A" for the course.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MahirI1009/CISC3130-Lab-7.git">Lab 7</a>
                <p>This is the repository that contains the code for Lab 7, the final project for CISC3130: Data Structures, which would be this website.
